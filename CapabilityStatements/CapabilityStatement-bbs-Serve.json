  "description": "This CapabilityStatement describes the minimal requirements for a server to fulfill the 'Serve image and report timeline' and 'Serve image and report' transactions within Image Availability. It is partly based on the CapabilityStatement defined by IHE ITI for the [Document Responder](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/CapabilityStatement/IHE.MHD.DocumentResponder).",
  "purpose": "This CapabilityStatement is informative in nature and does not represent the minimum or maximum set of capabilities the client or server should support. The aim is to design the CapabilityStatement as complete as possible, however for the exact set of capabilities the implementation guide should be consulted.",
