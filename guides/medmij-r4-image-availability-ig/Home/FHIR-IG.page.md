# FHIR IG

## Introduction
This IG describes a patient use case in the context of the [information standard "Image Availability" (Dutch: Beeldbeschikbaarheid or BBS), version 1.0.0-alpha.2](https://informatiestandaarden.nictiz.nl/wiki/Landingspagina_Beeldbeschikbaarheid). The information standard Image Availability as published by Nictiz does not yet include a patient use case, this may change in the future. Up until then, the patient use case will be published by MedMij.

This IG is a technical counterpart of the {{pagelink:FO, text: functional design}}. The FHIR version used for this IG is R4 (4.0.1).

**Table 1: Actors**

## Boundaries and relationships
This FHIR IG includes use cases for the exchange of images and reports between healthcare providers (e.g. hospitals) and patients (e.g. in a PHR setting).

This IG assumes that a PHR is able to make a connection to the right XIS that contains the patient's information. It does not provide information on finding the right source system nor does it provide information about security. These infrastructure and interface specifications are described in the [MedMij Afsprakenstelsel](https://afsprakenstelsel.medmij.nl/). In particular, each transaction is performed in the context of a specific authenticated patient, which has been established using the authentication mechanisms outlined in the MedMij Afsprakenstelsel (also see the [MedMij FHIR IG by Nictiz](https://informatiestandaarden.nictiz.nl/wiki/MedMij:IG:V1/FHIR_IG#Afsprakenstelsel)), i.e. via an OAuth2 token. Each XIS gateway is required to perform filtering based on the patient associated with the context for the request, so only the records associated with the authenticated patient are returned. For this reason, search parameters should not be included for patient identification.

## Relating FHIR (profiles) to its functional counterpart
The [BBS FHIR IG, section 5.3](https://informatiestandaarden.nictiz.nl/wiki/Bbs:V1_Alpha2_IG#MHD.2FWIA:_Mobile_access_to_Health_Documents_.2F_Web-based_Image_Access) describes the (intended) mapping between metadata, FHIR (DocumentReference) and the datasets in ART-DECOR. In this FHIR IG, we incorporate the aforementioned functional mapping provided by Nictiz BBS. This mapping has resulted in the {{pagelink:FHIR, text: bbs-DocumentReference profile}}.

## Identifiers
There are several identifiers that play a role in the exchange of images and reports. The following table gives an overview of all these identifiers, and how they are related to each other.

| Identifier | Source | Definition | FHIR DocumentReference element |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Document Unique ID | [Nationale IHE MetaData Set (2024)](https://decor.nictiz.nl/pub/nihemds/ihexds-html-20220712T144728/ds-2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.3.11.60.106.1.1-2013-12-04T122419.html), ihexds-dataelement-29 | The globally unique identifier of a document in XDS, assigned by the document source.

It links together the imaging study with its corresponding reports, images, and KOS documents. Moreover, it makes searching on imaging study level possible. <br/> Note that if a KOS document is shared or exchanged, the same Accession Number SHALL be present in the metadata attribute ReferenceIdList, as well as the corresponding FHIR DocumentReference resource. | `.context.related` |
| Study Instance UID | [DICOM](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.7.2.html) (0020,000D); <br/> [Nationale IHE MetaData Set (2024)](https://decor.nictiz.nl/pub/nihemds/ihexds-html-20220712T144728/ds-2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.3.11.60.106.1.1-2013-12-04T122419.html), ihexds-dataelement-117; <br/> [MedMij dataset](https://github.com/Stichting-MedMij/MedMij-R4-ImageAvailability/blob/main/dataset/Dataset_MedMij_Beeldbeschikbaarheid_1.0.0-beta.1.xlsx), bbs-medmij-dataelement-4 | The globally unique DICOM identifier of the imaging study upon which the imaging report is based, assigned by the modality or PACS. All images within an imaging study are implicitly linked to each other with this identifier. <br/> Each KOS document contains exactly one Study Instance UID according to [IHE WIA](https://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Web-based_Image_Access). <br/> Note that if a KOS document is shared or exchanged, the same Study Instance UID SHOULD be present in the metadata attribute ReferenceIdList, as well as the corresponding FHIR DocumentReference resource. | `.context.related` |
| Series Instance UID | [DICOM](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.7.3.html) (0020,000E) | The globally unique DICOM identifier of a single series that is part of the study identified by the Study Instance UID, and that contains the referenced object instance(s) (such as individual images). It is used to identify and organize related DICOM objects that are part of the same imaging series. | |
| SOP Class UID | [DICOM](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.12.html) (0008,0016) | The globally unique DICOM identifier of a Service-Object Pair (SOP) class. Each SOP class is defined by the union of a DICOM service and data object, and its [definition](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part04/sect_B.5.html) contains the rules and semantics which may restrict the use of the service. In Table 9 the SOP classes that need to be supported by the PHR are listed. | |
| SOP Instance UID | [DICOM](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.12.html) (0008,0018) | The globally unique DICOM identifier of a SOP instance (i.e. an individual DICOM object), which is an instantiation of a certain SOP class. Each SOP instance may contain a single image, multiple images or no image at all. | |

**Table 2: Identifiers relevant in the context of images and reports**

Note the following:
- The cardinality of `DocumentReference.masterIdentifier` is `1..1`. If a XIS wants to provide additional identifiers (e.g. a report identifier assigned in the EHR), the `DocumentReference.identifier` can be used.
- If the Accession Number is known, it SHALL be conveyed in all DocumentReference resources that refer to the corresponding images and reports. In particular, this ensures that images and reports that belong to the same imaging study, are linked together.
- When encoding a DICOM UID (e.g. Study Instance UID) in an Identifier datatype, use the `.system` *urn:dicom:uid*, and prefix the `.value` with *urn:oid:*.

## Use cases
The use cases in this IG are based as much as possible on the specifications described in the [BBS FHIR IG, section 5.3](https://informatiestandaarden.nictiz.nl/wiki/Bbs:V1_Alpha2_IG#MHD.2FWIA:_Mobile_access_to_Health_Documents_.2F_Web-based_Image_Access). In short: IHE [MHD](https://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Mobile_access_to_Health_Documents_(MHD)) and [WIA](https://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Web-based_Image_Access).

### Use case: Retrieve Image and Report in personal health environment
The Nictiz BBS FHIR IG splits the transactions in different use cases, for reasons of convenience. Seen from the perspective of a patient using a PHR, retrieval of images and reports from a healthcare provider is a related activity performed in one action. Therefore, this IG bundles the BBS use cases as one.

#### Query Timeline Data (MHD ITI-67)
> Based on [Use case 3: Query Timeline Data (Raadplegen Tijdlijn Data)](https://informatiestandaarden.nictiz.nl/wiki/Bbs:V1_Alpha2_IG#Use_case_3:_Query_Timeline_Data_.28Raadplegen_Tijdlijn_Data.29_3) in the Nictiz BBS FHIR IG, see [ITI-67](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/ITI-67.html) for further details.

The ITI-67 transaction is used to find available documents for a patient, based on a search on DocumentReference.

| Transaction group | Transaction | Actor | System role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Image and report timeline (PULL) | Retrieve image and report timeline | Patient (using a PHR) | MM-1.0-BR-FHIR |
| Image and report timeline (PULL) | Serve image and report timeline | Healthcare provider (using a XIS) | MM-1.0-BB-FHIR |

**Table 3: Transactions**

##### PHR: request message
The PHR executes an HTTP search against the DocumentReference endpoint of the XIS using the following URL:

`GET [base]/DocumentReference{?<query>}`

The `<query>` represents a series of encoded name-value pairs representing the filter for the query. The search parameters listed in the table below SHALL be supported by both PHR and XIS.

| Image Availability search parameter | Description | FHIR search parameter | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| availabilityStatus | Search on the status of the DocumentReference. | `status` | Retrieve all DocumentReference resources that refer to an approved document. <br/> `GET [base]/DocumentReference?status=current` <br/> |
| mimeType | Search on the MIME type of the document. | `contenttype` | Retrieve all DocumentReference resources that refer to a report in PDF format. <br/> `GET [base]/DocumentReference?contenttype=application/pdf` <br/> <br/> Retrieve all DocumentReference resources that refer to an imaging study available as DICOM KOS document. <br/> `GET [base]/DocumentReference?contenttype=application/dicom` |

**Table 4: Supported search parameters for ITI-67**

Since only approved documents are to be exchanged, the PHR SHALL always include the search parameter `status` with value *current* in their request:

`GET [base]/DocumentReference?status=current{&<additional parameters>}`

Other search parameters can be found in the [ITI-67 Request Message](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/ITI-67.html#23674121-query-search-parameters) specification. The PHR MAY supply all query parameters listed there, with the exception of the `patient` and `patient.identifier` search parameters, as patient identification is done differently in the MedMij context (i.e. via an OAuth2 token).

The XIS MAY be capable of processing some or all query parameters listed there. Note that this is a deviation from the ITI-67 specification, in which the XIS SHALL be capable of processing all listed query parameters. However, support of all these query parameters was deemed to pose a disproportionate implementation burden for the XIS, and is therefore not enforced here.

See [ITI-67 Request Message](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/ITI-67.html#236741-find-document-references-request-message) for further details.

##### XIS: response message
The XIS returns an HTTP Status code appropriate to the processing as well as a Bundle of the matching DocumentReference resources. Based on the value of `DocumentReference.category` it can be derived whether each respective DocumentReference refers to a report or an image (and hence, in what way the subsequent ITI-68 request should be handled). Other elements, such as `.content.attachment.contentType` and `.content.format`, also indicate whether the DocumentReference concerns a report or an image. The table below illustrates some of the possible values (i.e. `code`-`system` pairs) in the DocumentReference for reports and images, but it is not meant to be comprehensive.

| FHIR element | Image | Report (PDF) | Report (DICOM) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.category` | *IMAGES* (`urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.19376.1.2.6.1`) | *REPORTS* (`urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.19376.1.2.6.1`) | *REPORTS* (`urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.19376.1.2.6.1`) |
| `.content.attachment.contentType` | *application/dicom* or *application/dicom+json* | *application/pdf* | *application/dicom* or *application/dicom+json* |
| `.content.format` | *1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.1.88.59* (`http://dicom.nema.org/resources/ontology/DCMUID`) | Any code from `http://ihe.net/fhir/ValueSet/IHE.FormatCode.codesystem` in ValueSet [FormatCodes](https://simplifier.net/packages/medmij.fhir.nl.r4.imageavailability/1.0.0-beta.1/files/2949899) | *1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.1.88.59* (`http://dicom.nema.org/resources/ontology/DCMUID`) |
| `.context.event[modality]` | Any code from `http://dicom.nema.org/resources/ontology/DCM` in ValueSet [ModalityCombined](http://medmij.nl/fhir/ValueSet/ModalityCombined) | Empty or any code from `http://dicom.nema.org/resources/ontology/DCM` in ValueSet [ModalityCombined](http://medmij.nl/fhir/ValueSet/ModalityCombined) | Any code from `http://dicom.nema.org/resources/ontology/DCM` in ValueSet [ModalityCombined](http://medmij.nl/fhir/ValueSet/ModalityCombined), but often code *OT* |

**Table 5: Possible DocumentReference element values for reports and images**

#### Retrieve Imaging Report (MHD ITI-68)
> Based on [Use case 4: Retrieve Imaging Report (Raadplegen Verslag)](https://informatiestandaarden.nictiz.nl/wiki/Bbs:V1_Alpha2_IG#Use_case_4:_Retrieve_Imaging_Report_.28Raadplegen_Verslag.29_3) in the Nictiz BBS FHIR IG, see [ITI-68](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/ITI-68.html) for further details.

| Transaction group | Transaction | Actor | System role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Image and report (PULL) | Retrieve image and report | Patient (using a PHR) | MM-1.0-BR-FHIR |
| Image and report (PULL) | Serve image and report | Healthcare provider (using a XIS) | MM-1.0-BB-FHIR |

**Table 6: Transactions**

##### PHR: request message
The PHR sends an HTTP GET request to the XIS server to retrieve the imaging report content referenced by a DocumentReference in `DocumentReference.content.attachment.url`.

The PHR SHALL provide an HTTP Accept header to indicate the preferred MIME type, such that the XIS can provide the imaging report requested in an encoding other than the encoding indicated in the `DocumentReference.content.attachment.contentType`. The XIS SHALL support the Accept header *application/pdf*, irrespective of the value of `.contentType`. 

The PHR MAY supply a MIME type in the Accept header other than *application/pdf* or the MIME type indicated in `DocumentReference.content.attachment.contentType`. Support for such headers by the XIS is optional.

See [ITI-68 Request Message](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/ITI-68.html#236841-retrieve-document-request-message) for further details.

##### XIS: response message
The XIS returns an HTTP Status code appropriate to the processing. When the requested imaging report is returned, the XIS SHALL respond with HTTP Status Code 200, and the imaging report SHOULD use a correct content type based on the Accept header supplied in the request by the PHR. This MAY include CDA, PDF, or other structured or unstructured formats originating from an EHR.

If the XIS is unable to format the imaging report in a content type listed in the Accept header, it SHALL respond with HTTP Status Code 406.

See [ITI-68 Response Message](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/ITI-68.html#236842-retrieve-document-response-message) for further details.

#### Retrieve Images (MHD ITI-68 and WADO-RS RAD-107)
> Based on [Use case 5: Retrieve Images (Raadplegen Beeld)](https://informatiestandaarden.nictiz.nl/wiki/Bbs:V1_Alpha2_IG#Use_case_5:_Retrieve_Images_.28Raadplegen_Beeld.29_3) in the Nictiz BBS FHIR IG, see [ITI-68](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/ITI-68.html) for further details.

| Transaction group | Transaction | Actor | System role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Image and report (PULL) | Retrieve image and report | Patient (using a PHR) | MM-1.0-BR-FHIR |
| Image and report (PULL) | Serve image and report | Healthcare provider (using a XIS) | MM-1.0-BB-FHIR |

**Table 7: Transactions**

##### PHR: request message (MHD ITI-68)
The PHR sends an HTTP GET request to the XIS server to retrieve the imaging study manifest content referenced by a DocumentReference in `DocumentReference.content.attachment.url`.

The PHR SHALL provide an HTTP Accept header to indicate the preferred MIME type, such that the XIS can provide the imaging study manifest requested in an encoding other than the encoding indicated in the `DocumentReference.content.attachment.contentType`. The table below indicates which MIME types as value of the Accept header SHALL be supported by the XIS relative to the `.contentType` present in the DocumentReference for which the PHR requests the content. In particular, the XIS has to support reformatting a DICOM KOS document (with `.contentType` equal to *application/dicom*) into the [DICOM JSON Model](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part18/chapter_f.html) (with `.contentType` equal to *application/dicom+json*). 

The PHR MAY supply a MIME type in the Accept header other than those indicated by the table below or the MIME type indicated in `DocumentReference.content.attachment.contentType`. Support for such headers by the XIS is optional.

| `.contentType` (ITI-67 Response) | Accept header (ITI-68 Request) |
| --- | --- |
| *application/dicom* | *application/dicom* |
| *application/dicom* | *application/dicom+json* |
| *application/dicom+json* | *application/dicom+json* |

**Table 8: Mapping between content type and supported Accept headers**

See [ITI-68 Request Message](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/ITI-68.html#236841-retrieve-document-request-message) for further details.

##### XIS: response message (MHD ITI-68)
The XIS returns an HTTP Status code appropriate to the processing. When the requested imaging study manifest is returned, the XIS SHALL respond with HTTP Status Code 200, and the imaging study manifest SHOULD use a correct content type based on the Accept header supplied in the request by the PHR. The imaging study manifest SHOULD contain references to the relevant images following the [WADO-RS format](https://www.dicomstandard.org/using/dicomweb/retrieve-wado-rs-and-wado-uri/).

If the XIS is unable to format the imaging study manifest in a content type listed in the Accept header, it SHALL respond with HTTP Status Code 406.

See [ITI-68 Response Message](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/ITI-68.html#236842-retrieve-document-response-message) for further details.

##### PHR: request message (WADO-RS RAD-107)
The WADO-RS Retrieve request (RAD-107) is used to retrieve individual (image) instances. For each (image) instance the PHR wants to retrieve, it executes an HTTP GET against the WADO-RS endpoint of the XIS using the following URL:

`GET [WadoRsEndpoint]/studies/[StudyInstanceUID]/series/[SeriesInstanceUID]/instances/[SOPInstanceUID]{/rendered}`

Note the following:
- The required `[StudyInstanceUID]`, `[SeriesInstanceUID]` and `[SOPInstanceUID]` unique identifier values can be found in the DICOM KOS document, which is obtained via the ITI-68 Retrieve Document transaction. In Table 2, the corresponding DICOM tags are listed. Note however, that the SOP Instance UID of an individual instance which is referenced by the KOS document can be found in DICOM tag `(0008,1155)` (Referenced SOP Instance UID) within the KOS document.
- By default, the request returns binary DICOM instances, while adding `/rendered` to the request results in rendered instances, e.g. in JPEG format (also see Table 10).

Instead of constructing the above URL from scratch by searching all these identifier values from various locations within the KOS document, DICOM tag `(0008,1115)` (Referenced Series Sequence) provides a structured way to access this information. This sequence contains one or more referenced image series. Each item in the sequence corresponds to a specific series and contains:
- Retrieve URL `(0008,1190)`
- A sequence of referenced instances (Referenced SOP Sequence `(0008,1199)`), each containing:
  - Referenced SOP Class UID `(0008,1150)`
  - Referenced SOP Instance UID `(0008,1155)`

To simplify the construction of the WADO-RS request, the Retrieve URL `(0008,1190)` can be used, as it attains the value

`[WadoRsEndpoint]/studies/[StudyInstanceUID]/series/[SeriesInstanceUID]`

for each series. To create the WADO-RS request with which the image (i.e. SOP instance) is retrieved, the PHR would then only need to append the value of the corresponding Referenced SOP Instance UID `(0008,1155)` as follows: 

`[RetrieveURL]/instances/[SOPInstanceUID]`

This approach allows the PHR to iterate over all items in the KOS document in the Referenced Series Sequence `(0008,1115)`.

The table below indicates the minimal set of SOP classes that SHALL be supported by the PHR. If, for a certain series in the sequence, a SOP Class UID is present in DICOM tag `(0008,1150)` other than those specified below, the PHR MAY still retrieve the corresponding image, but is not required to do so.
