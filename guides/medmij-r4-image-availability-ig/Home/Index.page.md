This is the implementation guide for MedMij R4 Image Availability, also known as "Beeldbeschikbaarheid" or "BBS". 

Please note that this guide is currently in its prototype phase. It serves as an initial version to help you get started and provide insights into the key steps of implementation. As we progress through the prototype phase, we are actively gathering feedback, identifying areas for improvement, and documenting lessons learned.

A new version of this guide will be released after the alpha (PoC) phase is complete. The updated version will include additional insights, refinements, and comprehensive details based on everything we encountered during this phase.
