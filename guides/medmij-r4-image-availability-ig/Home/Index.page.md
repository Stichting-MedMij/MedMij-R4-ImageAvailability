This is the implementation guide for MedMij R4 Image Availability, also known as "Beeldbeschikbaarheid" or "BBS". 

Please note that this guide is currently in its release candidate phase. As we progress through this phase, we are actively gathering feedback, identifying areas for improvement, and documenting lessons learned.

A new version of this guide will be released after the release candidate phase is complete. The updated version will include additional insights, refinements, and comprehensive details based on everything we encountered during this phase.

For questions or feedback on the IG, please reach out to MedMij via [info@medmij.nl](mailto:info@medmij.nl).
